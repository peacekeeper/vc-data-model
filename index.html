      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
Granting a benefit requires proof and verification. Some benefits demand
a formal process that includes three parties. In this process,
the <strong>holder</strong> asks for the benefit and the <strong>verifier
</strong> grants or denies the benefit based on verification of the holderâ€™s
qualification from a trusted <strong>issuer</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, we use a
driver's licenses to prove that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle,
a university degree to prove our education status, and government-issued
passports to grant travel between countries. This specification provides a
standard way to express these claims on the Web in a way that is
cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and automatically verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
For those that are unfamiliar with the concepts related to verifiable claims,
the following sections provide an overview of:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
what a verifiable claim contains,
        </li>
        <li>
an ecosystem where verifiable claims are expected to be useful, and
        </li>
        <li>
the use cases and requirements that informed this specification

      <h3>What is a Verifiable Claim?</h3>

      <p class="issue">
Expand on introductory verifiable claims section that doesn't dive too deeply
into the details but rather provides an overview of what we're trying to

      <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

      <p>
This section outlines a basic set of roles and an ecosystem where verifiable
claims are expected to be useful. In this section, we distinguish the essential
roles of core actors and the relationships between them; how do they interact?
A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many different ways. The
separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and/or protocols for
standardization. The following roles are introduced in this specification:
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-title="Incomplete list of roles and terminology">
The VCWG is actively discussing the number of roles and terminology used
in this specification.
The group expects terminology and role identification to be an ongoing
discussion and will be influenced by
public feedback on the specification. At present, the following incomplete
list of roles and terminology have been considered: Subject, Issuer, Authority,
Author, Signatory, Holder, Presenter, Asserter, Claimant, Sharer,
Subject's Agent, Prover, Mediator, Inspector, Evaluator, Verifier, Consumer, and
Relying Party. Some of these are aliases for the same concept, others are
possibly new roles in the ecosystem. Reviewers should be aware that the
terminology used in this document is not necessarily final and the group is
actively soliciting feedback on the roles and terminology used in this
specification.

the rest of the concepts in this specification. Other ecosystems exist, such as
protected environments or proprietary systems, where verifiable claims also
provide benefit.

      <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
      <p>
The Verifiable Claims Use Cases[[VC-USECASES]] document outlines a number of
key topics that readers may find useful, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
a more thorough explanation of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-roles">roles</a>
introduced above,
        </li>
        <li>
the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-needs">needs</a>
identified in market verticals like education, finance, healthcare, retail,
professional licensing, and government,
        </li>
        <li>
common
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-tasks">tasks and requirement</a>
performed by the roles in the ecosystem, and
        </li>
        <li>
common
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-sequences">sequences and flows</a>
identified by the Working Group.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, a number of
desirable capabilities have been identified as requirements for this
specification, specifically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST receive and store <a>verifiable claims</a> from
<a>issuers</a> through an agent that the issuer does not need to trust.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> SHOULD be positioned between <a>issuers</a> and <a>verifiers</a>
and mediate the transmission of <a>verifiable claims</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST provide <a>verifiable claims</a> to <a>verifiers</a>
through an agent that verifiers needn't trust; they only need to trust
<a>issuers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable claims</a> MUST be associated with <a>subjects</a>, not
particular services; <a>holders</a> SHOULD decide how to aggregate and manage
<a>verifiable claims</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> SHOULD be able to easily control and own their own identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST control which <a>verifiable claims</a> to use and when.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST be able to freely choose and change the agents they employ
to help them manage and share their <a>verifiable claims</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> that share <a>verifiable claims</a> MUST NOT be required to
reveal the identity of the <a>verifier</a> to <a>issuers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>verifiable claim</a> MUST be expressed in one or more standard,
machine-readable data formats for expressing <a>verifiable claims</a> which
can also be extended with minimal coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable claims</a> MUST be able to be indepenently issued, stored, and
verified.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable Claims</a> MUST be able to be revoked by the <a>issuer</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="issue">
There are
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-tasks">other requirements</a>
listed in the Verifiable Claims Use Cases
document that may or may not be aligned with the requirements listed above.
The VCWG will be ensuring alignment of the list of requirements from both
documents over time and will most likely move the list of requirements to a
single document.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>

        data-oninclude="restrictReferences">
      </div>

      <p class="issue" data-number="55" data-title="Multiple subjects in a credential">
It is currently possible to include multiple subjects in a credential. The
terminology above glosses over that fact. The group is debating if the
terminology should be modified to include this nuance, or if the nuance would
make grasping the basic concepts more difficult.

      <h2>Core Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline core data model concepts, such as
<a>claims</a>, <a>credentials</a>, and <a>profiles</a>, that form the
foundation of this specification.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Claims</h3>

        <p>
A <a>claim</a> is statement about a <a>subject</a>.
A <a>subject</a> is an <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> may be made.
<a>Claims</a> are expressed using
<strong><em>subject</em></strong>-<dfn data-lt="property|properties">property</dfn>-<dfn>value</dfn>
relationships.
        </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/claim.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic structure of a claim.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
The data model for <a>claims</a> described above is powerful and can be used to
express a large variety of statements. For example, whether or not someone is
over the age of 21 may be expressed as follows:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/claim-example.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
An example of a basic claim that expresses that Pat is over the age of 21.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
These claims may be merged together to express a graph of
information about a particular subject. The example below extends the
data model above by adding claims that state that Pat knows Sam and that
Sam is employed as a professor.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="75%" src="diagrams/claim-extended.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
Multiple claims may be combined to express a more complex graph.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
At this point, the concept of a <a>claim</a> has been introduced. To make the
claim verifiable, more information must be added to the graph of information.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Credentials</h2>

      <p>
A <a>credential</a> is set of one or more <a>claims</a> about a <a>subject</a>.
It typically includes an identifier to uniquely identify the
credential. Credential metadata may also be included to express concepts
such as when the credential expires. A digital signature is almost always
appended by the <a>issuer</a> of the credential to enable verifiability of
the credential. Therefore, a <strong>verifiable credential</strong> is a set
of claims that are tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be
cryptographically verified.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="50%" src="diagrams/credential.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic components of a verifiable credential.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Examples of verifiable credentials include digital employee identification
cards, digital proofs of age, and digital educational certificates.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Profiles</h2>

      <p>
As this specification takes a privacy-first approach, it is important that
the entities that use this technology are able to express only the portions of
their persona that are appropriate for the situation. The expression of a
subset of one's persona is called a <a>verifiable profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>verifiable profile</a> is a collection of one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a> typically about the same <a>subject</a> that
have been issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. The aggregation of this
information typically expresses an aspect of a person, organization, or entity.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/profile.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic components of a verifiable profile.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Examples of different profiles include a person's professional persona, online
gaming persona, or home life persona.
      </p>

        <h2>Issuer</h2>
        <p>
Issuer information may be expressed via the following <a>properties</a>:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>issuer</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of this property MUST be a URI. It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing
the URI results in a document containing machine-readable information about
the issuer that may be used to verify the information expressed in the
<a>credential</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><var>issued</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of this property MUST be a string value of an [[!ISO8601]] combined
date and time string and represents the date and time the <a>credential</a>
was issued. Note that this date represents the earliest date when the
information associated with the <var>claim</var> property became valid.

        <dl>
          <dt><var>signature</var></dt>
          <dd>
The method used for a signature will vary byrepresentation language.  However,
this property is expected to have a value that is a set of name-value pairs
including at least a signature, a reference to the signing entity, and
a representation of the signing date.</dd>

      <h1>Verification</h1>

      <p>
This section describes a number of checks required to verify a claim.
Some checks are essential for all verifiable claims, while some are
applicable to only some claims.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Document is syntactically valid (e.g. JSON, JSON-LD).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Credential</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Required properties are present. For example, for a
          Credential, <code>type</code> and <code>claim</code> are
          required.</li>
          <li>Property values match expectations described in the
          specification. For example, the document type for a verifiable
          claim must contain the class "Credential".</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Issuer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>issuer</code> id must match expectations. Likely,
          that means it is the id of a known and trusted <a>verifiable
          profile</a>.</li>
          <li>Recent metadata about the <code>issuer</code> which was published
          by the issuer MUST be available.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Subject</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The claim subject identifier must match expectations.
          Likely, that means it is the id of a known and trusted
          <a>verifiable profile </a> for the subject of the claim. If the
          entity that is subject of a claim has transmitted it to the
          verifier, the subject may be able to prove ownership of key
          identifying properties such as email address(es) and public
          key(s).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Signature</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The document signature is available in the form of a known
          signature suite.</li>
          <li>Required signature properties are present. For example, for a
          Linked Data Signature, <code>type</code>, <code>created</code>,
          <code>creator></code>, and <code>signatureValue</code> are present.
          </li>
          <li>The public key associated with the signature is available
          and a trustworthy link between this signing key and the
          issuer's <a>verifiable profile</a> may be established. The key must
          not be revoked or expired.</li>
          <li>The cryptographic signature is valid.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Expiration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>issued</code> date must be in the expected range.
          For example, a verifier may wish to ensure that the recorded
          issued date of valid claims is not in the future.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Revocation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If revocation instructions are present, the claim must not
          have been revoked.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Fitness for Purpose</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The custom properties in the <a>claim</a> should be
          appropriate for the verifier's purpose. For example if an
          verifier needs to determine that a subject is older than 21
          years of age, they may accept claims of specific birthdate or
          abstract properties such as <code>ageOver</code>.</li>
          <li>The issuer is trusted by the verifier to make the claims
          at hand. For example, Fast Food Resturant A will not be trusted
          to make a claim that an individual may enjoy a lifetime 10%
          discount to its competitor Fast Food Restaurant B.</li>
          <li>If the <a>issuer</a> has placed any policy information about
          the use of the <a>credential</a>, e.g. intended
          <a>verifiers</a>, expiration date, etc., that this
          policy is adhered to.</li>
          <li>If the <a>holder</a> has placed any policy information about
          the use of the <a>credential</a>, e.g. intended
          <a>verifiers</a>, restricted usage rights, etc., that this
          policy is adhered to.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Syntaxes</h2>

      <p>This section defines how the data model described in
      Section <a href="data-model"></a> is realized in each of 3
      different languages: JSON, JSON-LD, and WebIDL.  Although
      syntactic mappings are only provided for these three different
      languages, applications and services may also use any other data
      representation language (XML, for example) that can support the
      data model.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>JSON</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>Verifiable Credential</h2>
            <p>In JSON, an instance of the Verifiable Credential
            is expressed as a single JSON object whose
            properties are the verifiable credential's
            <a>properties</a>, with the following value type assignments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any number value MUST be represented as a Number type.</li>
              <li>Any boolean value MUST be represented as a Boolean type.</li>
              <li>Any sequence value MUST be represented as an Array type.</li>
              <li>Any unordered set of values MUST be represented as
              an Array type.</li>
              <li>Any set of <a>properties</a> MUST be represented as
              an Object type.</li>
              <li>Any empty value MUST be represented as a null value.</li>
              <li>Any other value MUST be represented as a String type.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express
            an <a>verifiable credential</a> containing a simple
            (unverifiable) <a>claim</a> about a particular
            <a>subject</a>. In this case, the claim is that
            the <a>subject</a> with
            the <a href="#entity-id">Verifiable Profile <var>id</var></a>
            of
            <code>did:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21</code> is 21 years
            of age or older. While a human reading the
            property <code>ageOver</code> may be able to guess its
            meaning by its name, no machine-readable semantics for the
            name are provided. There is information about the <a>claim</a>
            itself, such as an identifier for the <a>entity</a> that issued
            it and a date for when it was issued. </p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple claim">{
  <span class="subject">"id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21"</span>, <span class="comment">// subject identifier</span>
  <span class="property">"ageOver": 21</span> <span class="comment">// property-value pair</span>
}</pre>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express the
            same <a>claim</a> about the same <a>subject</a>, but in a
            verifiable form. As such, it contains
            a <code>signature</code> that can be used to verify its
            entire contents, including the claim.</p>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express a
            simple (unverifiable) <a>claim</a> about a particular
            <a>subject</a>. In this case, the claim is that
            the <a>subject</a> with
            the <a href="#entity-id">Entity
            Profile <var>id</var></a>
            of <code>did:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21</code> is 21
            years of age or older. While a human reading the
            property <code>ageOver</code> may be able to guess its
            meaning by its name, the context maps it to a global
            identifier (URL) where a document could be retrieved that
            provides its semantics in a machine-readable data
            format. There is also information about the <a>claim</a>
            itself, such as an identifier for the <a>entity</a> that
            issued it and a date for when it was issued.</p>

  "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
  "ageOver": 21
}</pre>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express the
            same <a>claim</a> about the same <a>subject</a>, but in a
            verifiable form. As such, it contains
            a <code>signature</code> that can be used to verify its
            entire contents, including the claim.</p>

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying the verifiable claims data model into production
environments.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Spectrum of Privacy</h3>
        <p>
It is important to recognize that there is a spectrum of privacy that ranges
from pseudo-anonymous to strongly identified. Depending on the use case,
people have different appetites when it comes to what information they
are willing to provide and what information may be derived from what
is provided.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="80%"
            src="diagrams/privacy-spectrum.svg">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
- Privacy is a spectrum that ranges from pseudo-anonymous to fully identified.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
For example, one would most likely desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol because the regulatory check thatâ€™s required is solely whether or
not the person is above a particular age. However, when a doctor is writing a
prescription for a patient, the pharmacy fulfilling the prescription is
required to more strongly identify the medical professional. Therefore it
is important to recognize that there is not one approach to privacy that
works for all use cases; privacy solutions tend to be use case specific.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
Even if one may desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol, a photo ID may still be required to provide appropriate
assurance to the merchant. The merchant may not need to know your
name or other details (other than that you are over a certain age),
but in many cases a mere proof of age may still be insufficient to
meet regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
The Verifiable Claims data model strives to support the full spectrum of
privacy and does not take philosophical positions on the right level of
anonymity for any particular transaction. The following sections provide
guidance for implementers that want to avoid specific scenarios that are
hostile to privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

        <p>
The data associated with verifiable claims stored in the
<code>credential.claim</code> field are largely susceptible to privacy
violations when shared with Verifiers. Personally identifying data
such as a government-issued identifier, shipping address, and full name
can be easily used to determine, track, and correlate an entity. Even
information that does not seem personally identifiable like the
combination of a birth date and zip code have very powerful correlation
and de-anonymizing capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers are strongly advised to
warn Holders when they share data with these sorts of characteristics.
Issuers are strongly advised to provide privacy-protecting credentials
when possible. For example, issuing ageOver credentials instead of
birthdate credentials when the Verifier desires to determine if an

        <h3>Identifier-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
Subjects of verifiable claims are identified via the
<code>credential.claim.id</code> field. The identifiers that are used
to identify the subject of a claim create a danger of correlation when
the identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one web domain.
        </p>
        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are a requirement in a system using
verifiable claims, it is strongly advised that identifiers are bound to a
single origin or that identifiers are single-use or not used at all and
are replaced by short-lived, single use bearer tokens.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Signature-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
The contents of verifiable claims are secured via the
<code>credential.signature</code> field. The properties in this field
create a danger of correlation when the same values are used across more than
one session or domain and the value does not change. Examples include the
<code>creator</code>, <code>created</code>,
<code>domain</code> (for very specific domains),
<code>nonce</code>, and <code>signatureValue</code> fields.
        </p>

        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are desired,
it is advised that signature values and metadata are regenerated
each time using technologies like third party pairwise signatures,
zero knowledge proofs, or group signatures. It is also important to note
that even when using anti-correlation signatures that information may still
be contained in the credential that defeats the anti-correlation properties
of the cryptography.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Device Fingerprinting</h3>

        <p>
There are mechanisms external to Verifiable Claims that are used to track and
correlate individuals on the Internet and the Web. Some of these mechanisms
include Internet Protocol address tracking, Web Browser fingerprinting,
Evercookies, Advertising Network trackers, mobile network position information,
and in-application Global Positioning System APIs. The use of Verifiable
Claims cannot prevent the use of these other tracking technologies. In addition,
when these technologies are used in concert with Verifiable Claims, new
correlatable information may be discovered. For example, a birthday coupled
with a GPS position can be used to strongly correlate an individual across
multiple websites.
        </p>

        <p>
It is advised that privacy preserving systems prevent the use of these other
tracking technologies when verifiable claims are being utilized. In some cases,
these tracking technologies may need to be disabled entirely on devices that
transmit verifiable claims on behalf of the Holder.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Favor Abstract Claims</h3>

        <p>
In order to enable recipients of verifiable claims to use them in a variety of circumstances without revealing more personally identifiable information than necessary for the transaction, issuers should consider limiting the information published in a claim to a minimal set needed for the expected purposes.
One way to avoid placing personally identifiable information in a claim is to use an "abstract" property that meets the needs of verifiers without providing specific information about the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
An example in this document is the use of the <code>ageOver</code> property as opposed to a specific birthdate that would constitute much stronger personally identifiable information.
If retailers in a market commonly require purchasers to be older than a specific age, an issuer trusted in that market may choose to offer a credential claiming that subjects have met that requirement as opposed to offering claims of their specific birthdates.
This enables individual customers to purchase items without revealing specific personally identifiable information.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Principle of Minimum Disclosure</h3>

        <p>
Privacy violations occur when information divulged in one context leaks into
another. Accepted best practice for preventing such violations is to limit
the information requested, and received, to the absolute minimum necessary.
This minimal disclosure approach is required by regulation in multiple
jurisdictions, including HIPAA in the US and GDPR in the EU.
        </p>
        <p>
With verifiable claims, minimal disclosure for issuers means limiting the
content of a claim to the minimum required by potential verifiers for
expected use. For verifiers, it means limiting the scope of claims
request or required for accessing services.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, a driver's license containing a driver's ID number,
height, weight, birthday, and home address is an example of a claim set
containing more information than is necessary to establish that the person
is above a certain age.
        </p>

        <p>
It is considered a best practice for issuers to atomize information or
use a signature scheme that allows for selective disclosure.
For example, an issuer
that issues driver's licenses could issue a claim set containing every
attribute that appears on a driver's license in addition to individual
claims (a singular claim containing the person's birthday), and individual
claims that are more abstract (a singular claim containing an
<code>ageOver</code> attribute). In addition, the issuer is encouraged to
provide secure HTTP endpoints for retrieving single-use bearer credentials to
promote the pseudonymous usage of claims when it is safe for the issuer to
issue such claims.
        </p>
        <p>
Similarly, verifiers are urged to only request information that is absolutely
necessary for a particular transaction to occur. This is important for at
least two reasons: 1) it reduces the liability on the verifier for
handling highly sensitive information that it does not need, and 2)
it enhances the privacy of the individual by only asking for information
that is required for the particular transaction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Bearer Credentials</h3>

        <p>
A <em>bearer credential</em> is a privacy enhancing piece of information,
such as a concert ticket, that entitles the <a>holder</a> of the credential to a
particular resource without divulging sensitive information about the holder.
        </p>

        <p>
Verifiable Credentials that are bearer credentials are possible by not
specifying the <a>subject</a> identifier, expressed using the 
<code>id</code>property that is nested in the <code>claim</code> property.
For example, the following Verifiable Credential is a bearer credential:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Usage of issuer properties">
{
  "id": "http://dmv.example.gov/credentials/temporary/28934792387492384",
  "type": ["Credential", "ProofOfAgeCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://dmv.example.gov/issuers/14",
  "issued": "2017-10-22T12:23:48Z",
  "claim": {
    <span class="comment">// note that the 'id' property is not specified for bearer credentials</span>
    "ageOver": 21
  },
  "signature": { ... }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
While bearer credentials can be privacy enhancing, their use must be carefully
crafted to not accidentally divulge more information than the holder of the
credential expects. For example, repeated use of the same bearer credential
across sites enables each site to potentially collude to unduly track or
correlate the holder. Additionally, information that may seem non-identifying
such as a birth date and zip code can be used to statistically identify an
individual when used together in the same credential or session.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> of bearer credentials SHOULD ensure that bearer credentials that
are expected to provide privacy enhancing benefits 1) are single use, when
possible, 2) do not contain personally identifying information, and 3) are not
unduly correlatable.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Holders</a> SHOULD be warned by their software if bearer credentials
containing sensitive information are issued or requested, or if there is a
correlation risk when combining two or more bearer credentials across one
or more sessions. While it may be impossible to detect all correlation risks,
some may be detectable.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiers</a> SHOULD NOT request bearer credentials that can be used to
unduly correlate the user.

      <section>
        <h3>Storage Providers and Data Mining</h3>

        <p>
When a holder receives a claim from an issuer, the
claim will need to be stored somewhere (e.g. in a credential repository).
Holders are warned that the information in a verifiable claim may be
sensitive in nature and highly individualized, making it a high value
target for data mining. Therefore, there may be services
that store verifiable claims for free and mine personal data and sell it
to organizations that desire individualized profiles on people and
organizations (i.e. if the service is free, you are the product).
        </p>
        <p>
It is suggested that holders be aware of the terms of service for their
credential repository, specifically the correlation and data mining
protections that are in place for those who store their verifiable claims
at the service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
There are a number of effective mitigations for data mining and profiling:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Use service providers that do not sell your information to third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that encrypts verifiable claims such that a service provider
cannot view the contents of the claims.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that stores verifiable claims locally on a device that you
control and that does not upload or analyze your information beyond
your expectations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Aggregation of Credentials</h3>

        <p>
Two pieces of information about the same <a>subject</a> almost always reveals
more information than just a single piece of information, even when delivered
through different channels. The aggregation of credentials is a privacy risk and
all participants in the ecosystem need to be aware of the risks of data
aggregation.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, if a bearer credential for an email address and then a bearer
credential
stating that the holder is over the age of 21 are provided across multiple
sessions, the verifier of the information has 1) a unique identifier to
associate with the individual, and 2) age related information for that
individual. It then becomes trivial to
create a profile for the holder such that more and more information is leaked
over time. Aggregation of credentials can be performed across multiple sites that
are colluding as well, leading to privacy violations.
        </p>

        <p>
Preventing the aggregation of information is a very difficult privacy problem
to address from a technological perspective. While new cryptographic techniques,
such as zero knowledge proofs, have been proposed as solutions to the problem
of aggregation and correlation, the existence of long-lived identifiers
and browser tracking techniques easily defeat even the most modern
cryptographic techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
The solution to the privacy implications of correlation or aggregation tend
to not be technological in nature, but policy driven instead. Therefore, if
a holder does not wish information to be aggregated about them, then they
must express this in the <a>verifiable profiles</a> that they transmit.
        </p>

        <p class="issue" data-number="48">
The group is currently exploring various mechanisms to express the usage
policy for the Verifiable Profile. These mechanisms have also been called
consent receipts, terms of usage, or DO_NOT_TRACK / DO_NOT_CORRELATE flags.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>

        <p>
Despite the best efforts to assure privacy, the actual use of verifiable
claims can potentially lead to de-anonymization and a loss of privacy.
This correlation can occur:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
When the same claim is presented to the same verifier more than once â€“
that verifier could infer that the holder is the same individual.
          </li>
          <li>
When the same claim is presented to different verifiers, and either those
verifiers collude or a third party has access to transaction records from
both verifiers â€“ the observant party could infer that the individual
presenting the claims is the same person at both services, i.e., the
accounts are controlled by the same person.
          </li>
          <li>
When the same subject identifier of a claim refers to the same subject across
presentations or verifiers. Even when different claims are presented,
if the subject identifier is the same, verifiers (and those with access to
verifier logs) could infer that the holder of the claims is the same
person.
          </li>
          <li>
When the underlying information in a claim can be used to identify an
individual across services â€“ using information from other sources
(including information provided directly by the user), verifiers can use
the information inside the claim to correlate the individual with an
existing profile. For example, if a holder presents claims that include
zip code, age, and sex, the verifier can potentially correlate the
subject of that claim with an established profile [see Sweeney 2000 <a href="http://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf">Simple
            Demographics Often Identify People Uniquely</a>].
          </li>
          <li>
When passing the identifier of a claim to a centralized revocation server â€“ the
centralized server can correlate the claim usage across interactions. For
example, if a verifiable claim is used for proof of age in this manner, the
centralized service could know everywhere that claim was presented: all
liquor stores, bars, adult stores, lottery purchases, etc.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
Itâ€™s possible to mitigate this in part:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
Use a globally unique identifier as the subject for any given claim and never
re-use that claim.
          </li>
          <li>
If the claim supports revocation, use a globally distributed service for revocation.
          </li>
          <li>
Design revocation APIs that do not depend on submitting the ID
of the claim, e.g., use a revocation list rather than a query.
          </li>
          <li>
Avoid associating personally identifiable information with any particular
long-lived subject identifier.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It is understood that these mitigation techniques are not always practical
or even compatible with necessary usage. Sometimes correlation is the point.
        </p>
        <p>
In state prescription monitoring programs, usage monitoring is a
requirement: enforcement entities need to be able to confirm that
individuals are not cheating the system to get multiple prescriptions
for controlled substances. This statutory or regulatory need to correlate
usage overrides individual privacy concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
Verifiable claims will so be used to intentionally correlate individuals
across services, for example, when using a common persona to log in to
multiple services, so all activity on each of those services is
intentionally linked to the same individual. This is not a privacy issue
as long as each of those services uses the correlation in the expected
manner.
        </p>

        <p>
Privacy risks of claim usage occur when unintended or unexpected
correlation arises from the presentation of verifiable claims.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Sharing Information with the Wrong Party</h3>

        <p>
When a <a>holder</a> chooses to share information with a <a>verifier</a>, it
may be the case that the verifier is acting in bad faith and requests
information that could be used to harm the holder. For example, a
verifier may ask for a bank account number, which could then be used in
concert with other information to defraud the holder or the bank.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> should strive to tokenize as much information as possible such
that if a holder accidentally transmits credentials to the wrong
verifier that the information loss isn't catastrophic.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, instead of including a bank account number
for the purposes of checking a bank balance for an individual, provide a
token that enables the verifier to use the token to check to see if the
balance is above a certain amount. In this case, the bank could
issue a verifiable credential containing a token for checking balance
to a holder. A holder would then include the verifiable credential in a
verifiable profile and bind the token to a credit checking agency via a digital
signature. The verifier would then wrap the verifiable profile in their digital
signature, and hand it back to the issuer to dynamically check the account
balance.
        </p>

        <p>
This approach ensures that even if the holder shares the account balance token
with the wrong party that the attacker doesn't discover the bank account
number, nor the exact value in the account, and given the validity period for
the counter-signature, doesn't gain access to the token for more than a few
minutes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Frequency of Claim Issuance</h3>

        <p>
As Section <a href="#usage-patterns"></a> details, usage patterns can be
correlated into certain types of behavior. Part of this correlation is
mitigated when a <a>holder</a> uses a verifiable credential without the
knowledge of the <a>issuer</a>. Issuers may defeat this protection by making
their claims short lived and renewal automatic.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, an "over the age of 21" credential may be useful when gaining
access to a bar. If an issuer makes the credential have a very short expiration
date and an automatic renewal mechanism, then they could possibly correlate
the holder's behavior in a way that negatively impacts the holder.
        </p>

        <p>
Organizations providing software to holders should warn <a>holders</a> if they
repeatedly use credentials with short lifespans that could result in
behavior correlation. Issuers should avoid issuing claims in a way that
enables them to correlate usage patterns.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Prefer Single Use Credentials</h3>

        <p>
An ideal privacy respecting system would only require information to be
disclosed by the holder that is necessary for the interaction with the verifier.
The verifier would then record that the disclosure requirement was met and
forget any sensitive information that was disclosed. In many cases,
competing priorities, such as regulatory burden, prevent this ideal system
from being employed.
In other cases, long-lived identifiers prevent single use.
The design of any verifiable credentials ecosystem, however, should strive to
be as privacy respecting as possible by preferring single use credentials
when possible.
        </p>

        <p>
The usage of these type of credentials provides several benefits. The first
benefit is to verifiers who can be sure that the data in the credential is
fresh. The second benefit is to holders, who know that if there are no long
lived identifiers in the credential that the credential itself cannot be used
to track or correlate them online. Finally, the third benefit ensures that
there is nothing for attackers to steal, making the entire ecosystem safer
to operate within.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
There are a number of security considerations that <a>issuers</a>,
<a>holders</a>, and <a>verifiers</a> should be aware of when processing
data described by this specification. Ignoring or not understanding the
implications of this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it should not be interpreted as a complete list of all
security considerations. Implementers are urged to seek the advice of security
and cryptography professionals when implementing mission critical systems
using the technology outlined in this specification.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Cryptography Suites and Libraries</h3>

        <p>
The entire data model described in this specification is protected through the
use of cryptography. Implementers should be aware of the underlying
cryptography suites and libraries that are used to implement the
creation and verification of digital signatures and mathematical proofs
utilized by their systems when processing <a>credentials</a> and
<a>profiles</a>. Software developers with extensive experience implementing
or auditing systems that use cryptography must be used to ensure that
systems are properly designed. Proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red teaming</a>
is also suggested to remove bias from security reviews.
        </p>

        <p>
Cryptography suites and libraries have a shelf life and eventually fall to
new attacks and technology advances. Any production quality system must take
this reality into account and ensure that mechanisms exist to easily upgrade
old or broken cryptographic suites and libraries in a proactive manner.
Mechanisms should also exist to invalidate and replace existing credentials
in the event of a cryptography suite or library failure.
Regular monitoring of systems to ensure proper upgrades are made in a timely
manner are also important to ensure the long term viability of systems
processing verifiable claims.

        <h3>Bundling Dependent Claims</h3>
        <p>
It is considered a best practice for issuers to atomize information in a
credential, or use a signature scheme that allows for selective disclosure.
In the former case, if the atomization is not done securely by the issuer,
the holder might bundle together different credentials in a way that was not
intended by the issuer.
        </p>
        <p>
For example a university might issue two credentials to a person, each
containing two properties i.e. "Staff Member" in the
"Department of Computing" and "Post Graduate Student" in the
"Department of Economics". If these credentials are atomized into separate
properties, then the university would issue four credentials to the person,
each containing one of the following properties:
"Staff Member", "Post Graduate Student", "Department of Computing" and
"Department of Economics". The holder could then transfer
the "Staff Member" and "Department of Economics" to a verifier,
which together would comprise a false claim.
        </p>

        <p class="issue" data-number="17" data-title="Dependent claim mitigation strategy">

        <h3>Highly Dynamic Information</h3>

        <p>
When verifiable <a>credentials</a> are issued for highly dynamic information,
implementers should ensure that the expiration times for the credential are
set appropriately. Expiration periods that are longer than the timeframe
where the credential is valid may create exploitable security vulnerabilities.
Expiration periods that are shorter than the timeframe where the information
expressed by the credential is valid create a burden on <a>holders</a> and
<a>verifiers</a>. It is therefore important to set validity periods for
credentials that are appropriate to the use case and the expected lifetime
for the information contained in the credential.
